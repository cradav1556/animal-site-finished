<h3>The jaguar and the black mamba are unique in different ways if they weren't  dangerous people can have them as pets.The two animals can both live in rain forests they eat different things but somethings they may eat the samething.Also jaguars fur pattern is pretty unique it can create them a place to hide when because it helps them blend in with their hiding places.The black mamba can hunt its prey very well because when stalking it if its not seen you wouldn't know its coming because its very quiet and can strike you very fast and release its venom inside causing the prey to die slow then they well put it in their mouth and swallow. If some animals that are carnivores and are brave enough they will try to catch a black mamba as food and if they get lucky and catch it they will eat. Thats all i pretty much know about the jaguar and black member .</h3>
